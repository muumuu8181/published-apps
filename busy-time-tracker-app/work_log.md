## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning (0.5 hours)
**Time**: 09:00 - 09:30

#### Agent-Manager Task Delegation
- Called agent-manager for task distribution and management
- Set up comprehensive todo list with 9 main tasks
- Established priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Created work folder structure

#### Requirements Analysis
- Analyzed comprehensive requirements document
- Identified key constraints:
  - Express.js only dependency
  - Exact CSS specifications (80px buttons, 40/60 split)
  - 100 test cases requirement
  - Dual deployment strategy needed

#### Technology Decisions
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js (minimal approach)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Storage**: In-memory (server) + localStorage (static)
- **Testing**: Manual + specification-driven

### Phase 2: Project Structure & Package Setup (0.5 hours)
**Time**: 09:30 - 10:00

#### Directory Creation
```bash
mkdir -p busy-time-tracker-app/src
```

#### Package Configuration
- Created `package.json` with Express dependency
- Configured npm scripts:
  - `start`: Node.js server launch
  - `test`: Placeholder for future testing
  - `dev`: Development mode

#### Architecture Planning
- Planned dual implementation strategy:
  1. Server version: Full API with Express
  2. Static version: Self-contained HTML with localStorage

### Phase 3: Backend Development (1.5 hours)
**Time**: 10:00 - 11:30

#### Express Server Implementation
- Set up basic Express server structure
- Configured static file serving for `/src` directory
- Implemented middleware for JSON parsing
- Added error handling middleware

#### API Endpoint Development
**Implemented Routes**:
- `POST /start` - Activity initiation with validation
- `POST /stop` - Activity termination by ID
- `GET /records` - Complete activity history
- `GET /summary` - Statistical summaries
- `GET /download` - JSON export functionality
- `POST /clear` - Data reset with confirmation
- `GET /health` - Server status monitoring

#### Data Management System
```javascript
// Core data structure
let records = [];
let nextId = 1;
const MAX_RECORDS = 200;

// Record format
{
  id: number,
  category: string,
  start: timestamp,
  end: timestamp | null,
  duration: number
}
```

#### Validation & Security
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Category validation against allowed types
- Custom text length limits (50 characters)
- Duplicate activity prevention
- Record limit enforcement

#### Error Handling Implementation
- Standardized error response format
- Specific error messages:
  - "Already running" for duplicates
  - "Invalid: Empty custom activity" for empty custom input
  - "Limit exceeded" for 200+ records
  - "Invalid: Record not found" for invalid IDs

#### Logging System

  ```
  Operation: {type}, Category: {category}, Timestamp: {time}, Result: {status}
  ```
- Error logging with stack traces
- Performance monitoring points
